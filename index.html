            <p>BROWNELIXIR was founded by Madison Garrison, a college student at the time, with a mission to redefine skincare for melanin-rich skin by embracing the power of nature. Inspired by ancestral beauty rituals and traditional remedies, she believes in using only the finest organic and plant-based ingredients to nourish, heal, and protect. Working hard to meet those same standards, our products are free from harmful chemicals, ensuring that your skin thrives as it was meant to. At BROWNELIXIR, we celebrate self-care as an act of love, empowerment, and connection to our roots. Join us on our journey to radiant, healthy skin—naturally.

            <p>For generations, Black skin has been cared for with rich, natural ingredients derived from the earth—shea butter, cocoa butter, and essential oils. However, modern-day beauty industries have flooded the market with harmful chemicals, stripping our skin of its natural balance. At BROWNELIXIR, we embrace the wisdom of our ancestors, returning to holistic and nourishing remedies that heal, protect, and celebrate melanin-rich skin as it was always intended.</p>
